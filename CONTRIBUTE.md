Patches/pull requests welcome,
follow the usual `git` workflow for submitting a pull request:

-   fork the project
-   create a new branch from master (e.g. `features/my-new-feature` or
    `issue/123-my-bugfix`)

If you're fixing a bug also create an issue 
on [GitHub](https://github.com/phlummox/assumpta/issues)
if one doesn't exist yet.

If it's a new feature explain why you think it's useful or necessary.

Follow the same coding style with regards to spaces, semicolons, variable
naming etc. In general, we follow the usual Haskell naming convention of making
function and variable names `camelCase`
(even
when they include
[acronyms](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15526107/acronyms-in-camelcase)).
Mostly.

Please add tests for any contributions you make.
